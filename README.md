## Getting Started
[Up-4-ReVue](https://up-4-revue-client.onrender.com/)

From the landing page, you can navigate to the Albums page to see all the albums I have covered thus far. I'm starting out with my all time favorites and moving on from there!

Below are screenshots of the create, edit, and single album display pages. At present I am the only user able to add reviews to this site, but I plan to open it up to anyone in a future update!
